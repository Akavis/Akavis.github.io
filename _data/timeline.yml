- title: Deltalock Studios Ltd. | Director
  from: June 2019
  to: January 2020
  description: Deltalock Studios was created under good intentions of developing indie games. 
               With a large range of games that was set to begin within the short time frame,
               RTSR was the video game chosen as the face of the company and had gained interest
               from the eyes of publishers. My role at the company was to handle all the technical
               side of the business.
