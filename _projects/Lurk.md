			As a two week prototype, we wanted to create a truly novel experience -
			something that you could play with a friend and come away reeling from the visceral moments you shared
			(and didnâ€™t share!). With the core concept of dueling invisible opponents with only environmental cues
			to aid you - we quickly iterated through a variety of weapons and set pieces -
			and honed on an experience that exacerbated the constant feeling of unease and uncertainty.
