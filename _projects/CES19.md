			<a>
				For CES 2019, my co-workers and I at Puredepth APTIV were required to take our technology MLD (Multi-Layered Display) to showcase Driver State Sensing and Autonomous Safety. 
				My job in this project was to integrate APTIV's proprietary Driver State Sensing system modified with Affectiva and produce and effective display of the systems capabilities.
			</a>
			<h5><b>THE PROJECT:</b></h5>
			<a>
			Alongside one of the designers in our team, I managed to bring our minds together to create captivating content for the MLD.
			The focal point or center peice of the display was the Avatar. 
			This Avatar's movement and facial emotions was controlled through the real-time information from the camera and IR sensors pointed at the user.
			Around the Avatar was a myriad of 3D liquid graphs and information bars that would display emotion, drowsiness, cognitive workload, etc.
