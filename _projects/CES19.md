				<b>MLD</b> enhanced showcase of driver state detection and safety. 
				For this project I spent my time working on creating a display that captured and displayed the driver’s ‘state’,
				this meant that the systems would pick up the driver’s emotion, attention and other data, 
				and show it as an on-screen an avatar that would mimic the driver along side values and graphs.
