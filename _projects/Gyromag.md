			Gyromag is an online multiplayer where you compete in fast paced 4v4 battles.
			Use an extreme arsenal and bend gravity to your will to become the reigning champion. 
			It was developed over 8 months and was inspired by Quake and Unreal Tournament.
			Gyromag was soon placed onto Valve Corporation’s Steam Greenlight and was accepted to go through
			to their marketplace in less than a few weeks. 
			It has been showcased at both Auckland’s Armageddon and Melbourne’s PAX East events.
