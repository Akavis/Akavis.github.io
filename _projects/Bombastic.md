			Bombastic is a couch multiplayer platformer where you and your friends
			can compete in heated battle to win the prized skylands.
			Equipped with a trusty bomb launcher your objective blow
			your opponents off your flying island. 
			Originally built in a 48 hour game jam, my team of five decided to take it a little bit further
			and polish up it’s main game loop. 
			After polishing the game up, we were offered the opportunity 
			to port the game to a modern arcade machine to be displayed at Auckland’s Armageddon.
